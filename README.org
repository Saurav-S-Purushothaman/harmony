** Goals

    Build a load balancer that can send traffic to two or more servers.
    Health check the servers.
    Handle a server going offline (failing a health check).
    Handle a server coming back online (passing a health check).


** Usage

Start the load balancing server:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  ./src/harmony/load_balancer.bb
#+End_SRC

This will start the load balancing server on port 80 by default

To the backend server

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  ./src/harmony/be.bb <port-number>
#+End_SRC

Start multiple backend server on port : 1010, 1011, 1012 and 1013


NOTE: Currently load balancing server only checks and distribute request
to backend servers running on port 1010, 1011, 1012, and 1013. This can
be changed to make it dynmaic in the future.
